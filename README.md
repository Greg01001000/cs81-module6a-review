### CS 81 Module 6 Assignment 6A: Code Review, by GregH, 7/15/25

**playlist.js** came with a constructor method to create Playlist objects (named lists of songs to play), and several other methods for working with those objects. They use JavaScript's old .prototype syntax instead of its modern class syntax. I added explanatory comments, a suggestion for improvement, and a method to start playing any chosen song in the playlist.

**REFLECTION.md** has my answers to questions about what was hard to understand, what the 'this' keyword does, and how I would write the code differently.
